Composition:

_Core file_, `WSO.hs`, implementation of prefix networks described in \[1\]
(reference inside)

`Memo.hs`, generic memoization, by Koen Claessen

`ExamplesWSO.hs`, self-explanatory

`Numbers.hs`, code measuring various statistics (cur. widths and depths)
of produced networks

`Pretty.hs`, circuit pretty printer

`Makefile`, with a command generating *HTML* documentation for `WSO`:

    make

This will produce a file `doc/WSO.html`.
