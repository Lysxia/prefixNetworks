Composition:

_Core file_, `WSO.hs`, implementation of prefix networks described in [1]
(reference inside)

`Memo.hs`, generic memoization, by Koen Claessen.

`ExamplesWSO.hs`, self-explanatory

`Numbers.hs`, code measuring various statistics (cur. widths and depths)
of produced networks

`Makefile`, generate *HTML* documentation for `WSO`:

    make

This will produce a file doc/WSO.html
